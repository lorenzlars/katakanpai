# 🍻 Kata**kanpai**

A fun drinking game to help beginner Japanese learners practice reading katakana by guessing famous brand names written in Japanese characters.

## About

Katakanpai is a fun little project I built while attending a Japanese language school in Tokyo for a few months. It's a drinking game designed to help beginner Japanese learners practice reading katakana by guessing famous brand names written in Japanese characters.

The name "Katakanpai" is a play on "katakana" (カタカナ) and "kanpai" (乾杯 - cheers!).
